## Startup Idea Title  
**Jetski.ai**  

## Brief Description  
Jetski.ai provides a solution for developers by offering real-time, up-to-date documentation through AI agents, streamlining the development process. It bridges the gap between developers and the latest project resources, saving time and reducing errors.  

## Target Audience  
The target audience includes all developers, regardless of experience level, who rely on accurate and current documentation to build the best versions of their products without wasting time debugging unnecessary issues.  

## Problem Statement  
Many developers aim to create new software and ideas, but the growing gap between well-informed AI agents and up-to-date documentation hinders efficient developmentâ€”Jetski.ai solves this by connecting real-time data scraping of documentation with AI agents.  

## Initial Thoughts  
We are developing our own API and MCP server to enable Jetski users to connect and develop with the assistance of the most up-to-date documentation and information, ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow.
